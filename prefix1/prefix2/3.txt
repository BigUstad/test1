create-bucket
Description
Creates a new S3 bucket. To create a bucket, you must register with Amazon S3 and have a valid AWS Access Key ID to authenticate requests. Anonymous requests are never allowed to create buckets. By creating the bucket, you become the bucket owner.

Not every string is an acceptable bucket name. For information about bucket naming restrictions, see Working with Amazon S3 buckets .

If you want to create an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket, see Create Bucket .

By default, the bucket is created in the US East (N. Virginia) Region. You can optionally specify a Region in the request body. You might choose a Region to optimize latency, minimize costs, or address regulatory requirements. For example, if you reside in Europe, you will probably find it advantageous to create buckets in the Europe (Ireland) Region. For more information, see Accessing a bucket .

Note
If you send your create bucket request to the s3.amazonaws.com endpoint, the request goes to the us-east-1 Region. Accordingly, the signature calculations in Signature Version 4 must use us-east-1 as the Region, even if the location constraint in the request specifies another Region where the bucket is to be created. If you create a bucket in a Region other than US East (N. Virginia), your application must be able to handle 307 redirect. For more information, see Virtual hosting of buckets .

When creating a bucket using this operation, you can optionally specify the accounts or groups that should be granted specific permissions on the bucket. There are two ways to grant the appropriate permissions using the request headers.

Specify a canned ACL using the x-amz-acl request header. Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as canned ACLs . Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. For more information, see Canned ACL .

Specify access permissions explicitly using the x-amz-grant-read , x-amz-grant-write , x-amz-grant-read-acp , x-amz-grant-write-acp , and x-amz-grant-full-control headers. These headers map to the set of permissions Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see Access control list (ACL) overview . You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:

id – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an AWS account
uri – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group
emailAddress – if the value specified is the email address of an AWS account
Note
Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following AWS Regions:

US East (N. Virginia)
US West (N. California)
US West (Oregon)
Asia Pacific (Singapore)
Asia Pacific (Sydney)
Asia Pacific (Tokyo)
Europe (Ireland)
South America (São Paulo)
For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see Regions and Endpoints in the AWS General Reference.

For example, the following x-amz-grant-read header grants the AWS accounts identified by account IDs permissions to read object data and its metadata:

x-amz-grant-read: id="11112222333", id="444455556666"
Note
You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do both.

Synopsis
  create-bucket
[--acl <value>]
--bucket <value>
[--create-bucket-configuration <value>]
[--grant-full-control <value>]
[--grant-read <value>]
[--grant-read-acp <value>]
[--grant-write <value>]

[--object-lock-enabled-for-bucket | --no-object-lock-enabled-for-bucket]
[--cli-input-json <value>]
[--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
Options
--acl (string)

The canned ACL to apply to the bucket.

Possible values:

private
public-read
public-read-write
authenticated-read
--bucket (string)

The name of the bucket to create.
--create-bucket-configuration (structure)

The configuration information for the bucket.

LocationConstraint -> (string)

Specifies the Region where the bucket will be created. If you don't specify a Region, the bucket is created in the US East (N. Virginia) Region (us-east-1).
Shorthand Syntax:

LocationConstraint=string
JSON Syntax:

{
  "LocationConstraint": "af-south-1"|"ap-east-1"|"ap-northeast-1"|"ap-northeast-2"|"ap-northeast-3"|"ap-south-1"|"ap-southeast-1"|"ap-southeast-2"|"ca-central-1"|"cn-north-1"|"cn-northwest-1"|"EU"|"eu-central-1"|"eu-north-1"|"eu-south-1"|"eu-west-1"|"eu-west-2"|"eu-west-3"|"me-south-1"|"sa-east-1"|"us-east-2"|"us-gov-east-1"|"us-gov-west-1"|"us-west-1"|"us-west-2"
}
--grant-full-control (string)

Allows grantee the read, write, read ACP, and write ACP permissions on the bucket.
--grant-read (string)

Allows grantee to list the objects in the bucket.
--grant-read-acp (string)

Allows grantee to read the bucket ACL.
--grant-write (string)

Allows grantee to create, overwrite, and delete any object in the bucket.
--grant-write-acp (string)

Allows grantee to write the ACL for the applicable bucket.
--object-lock-enabled-for-bucket | --no-object-lock-enabled-for-bucket (boolean)

Specifies whether you want S3 Object Lock to be enabled for the new bucket.
--cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally.

--generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
